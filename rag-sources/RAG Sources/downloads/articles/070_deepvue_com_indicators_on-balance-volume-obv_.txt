What Is On-Balance Volume?

On-Balance Volume

(

OBV

) is a momentum indicator built around one idea: volume moves

before

price. It’s not about how much a stock moved—it’s about how much buying or selling power was behind the move.

Developed by Joseph Granville in 1963, OBV was his answer to the problem of price lag. He saw volume as a pressure gauge, building up quietly before an inevitable release. Think of it as a coiled spring on your chart.

OBV adds volume on up days, subtracts it on down days, and ignores sideways noise. The math is simple. The impact isn’t.

The OBV Formula (Without the Noise)

Let’s keep it clean:

If today’s close > yesterday’s close → OBV = Yesterday’s OBV + Today’s volume

If today’s close < yesterday’s close → OBV = Yesterday’s OBV – Today’s volume

If unchanged → OBV stays the same

That’s it. The result is a running tally of volume pressure. Ignore the absolute number. What matters is the slope.

Why OBV Still Matters

1. It Spots the Smart Money

OBV is a favorite for tracking institutional accumulation or distribution before price reacts. If volume spikes while price stalls, someone’s loading up.

When price finally catches up, it’s usually late. That’s why smart traders often combine OBV with

institutional ownership insights

.

2. Divergences Are the Main Course

The best OBV signals come when price and volume disagree:

Positive Divergence:

Price hits new lows, but OBV doesn’t? Selling pressure is drying up.

Negative Divergence:

Price makes new highs, but OBV flattens or falls? The rally’s running out of gas.

3. Breakouts That Stick

When OBV breaks a trendline

before

price does, that’s your whisper. Watch for price to follow.

Combine it with a moving average

or support level, and it’s no longer just a hunch.

OBV in Action: A Quick Walkthrough

Say a stock closes higher five days in a row, then falls for three, flattens, then ticks up again.

Volume from up days is added

Volume from down days is subtracted

Flat days? Ignored

Your OBV line will mirror the market’s pressure—not the price chop. Here’s what that might look like across 10 sessions:

Up days? Add volume. Down days? Subtract. OBV isn’t about where the price ends—it’s about who was moving the needle.

OBV vs. Accumulation/Distribution

Same goals, different paths.

OBV:

Binary logic. Up or down close? All-in volume or nothing.

Accumulation/Distribution (A/D):

More nuanced. It weighs where price closed within the day’s range.

OBV is blunt but fast. A/D adds detail, but can lag.

Limitations (Don’t Skip This)

OBV is a

leading

indicator. That’s both its edge and its flaw.

It can get ahead of itself.

Spikes in volume (news, earnings, ETF rebalancing) can distort the line for days.

Works better when paired with lagging indicators like moving averages.

Also, remember this: OBV’s value is cumulative

from a starting point you pick

. That means comparing OBV across assets is pointless. Only compare slopes, trends, and divergences.

When OBV Actually Helps

Trend Confirmation:

If OBV confirms higher highs, the trend’s alive. If not, look closer.

Trading Ranges:

Rising OBV in a range = quiet accumulation. Falling OBV = stealth exit.

Breakout Spotting:

If OBV breaks out before price, it’s your advance scout—especially helpful when

screening for breakout stocks

.

Final Word

OBV isn’t magic. It won’t give you a buy signal in neon lights. But it’s a damn good way to see what the big money’s doing before the crowd notices.

It’s clean, direct, and unfiltered. Just how volume should be.

Frequently asked questions

Is On-Balance Volume better than using raw volume bars?

Yes. On-Balance Volume gives cumulative context to trading volume, while raw volume bars just show isolated spikes. If you’re trying to read market intent—not just noise—On-Balance Volume tells you who’s really moving.

Can I use On-Balance Volume for intraday trading?

You can, but On-Balance Volume works better on daily or weekly charts. Intraday moves often include noise and false signals. On-Balance Volume needs time to show real accumulation or distribution.

Should I trade solely based on On-Balance Volume?

No. On-Balance Volume is a directional tool. It tells you where pressure is building but not when to act. Use it with price structure or trend-following indicators for a full picture.

Does On-Balance Volume work in all market conditions?

On-Balance Volume performs best in trending or coiling markets. In sideways, low-volume chop, signals can get murky. Wait for volume direction to clean up before relying on On-Balance Volume signals.
