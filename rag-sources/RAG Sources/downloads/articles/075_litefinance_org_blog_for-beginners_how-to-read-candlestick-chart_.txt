Major Takeaways

The Three White Soldiers is a sign of the beginning of a continuous trend. The pattern shows the strength of buyers, and we know that trends almost always begin with strong impulse movements.

The Three White Soldiers is a continuation pattern, not a reversal one. This important note will help you correctly determine the location of the pattern, which in turn is a key element in the analysis of the market with the help of Japanese candles.

The pattern will be considered stronger if the upper shadows of the candles are extremely small or completely absent. This phenomenon will be an additional confirmation of the strength of bulls.

Quite often the formation of the three white soldiers pattern is followed by a small correction usually not reaching the low of the second candle. However, one should be prepared to this turn of events as well - we must remember that there are no guarantees on the market.

The Three White Soldiers has 2 related models - Advance Block and Deliberation. I should note that these patterns have the properties of three white soldiers, but they require additional confirmation. I prefer not to use these patterns in my trading.

What Is The Three White Soldiers Pattern?

The "Three White Soldiers" candlestick pattern is a compelling bullish candlestick formation that typically unfolds during a downtrend. This pattern consists of three consecutive long and bullish candlesticks, each opening higher and closing significantly higher than the previous one. Visually resembling three advancing soldiers marching in unison, it conveys strength and momentum in the market, reflecting a shift in sentiment from bearishness to optimism. Traders often interpret this pattern as a signal of a potential trend reversal or a strong continuation of the existing upward trajectory, making it a valuable tool in the trader's arsenal. Embracing the Three White Soldiers

How To Identify The Three White Soldiers Pattern

Spotting the Three White Soldiers candlestick pattern in a price chart is like identifying a trio of cheerful soldiers marching confidently toward victory. This bullish candlestick formation is characterized by three consecutive white (or green) candles, each with an open and close higher than the previous one.

Here's the breakdown:

Soldier 1: This soldier opens the charge with a strong bullish move, closing near its high.

Soldier 2: The second soldier picks up the pace, opening higher than the previous close, and maintaining the bullish momentum by closing near its high as well.

Soldier 3: The third soldier seals the deal, opening higher once again and closing near its high. This final soldier reaffirms the trend's strength.

For a confirmed Three White Soldiers pattern, each candle's open and close should be higher than the previous one, showcasing the bulls' dominance. This formation signals a potential uptrend, making it a valuable tool in your trading arsenal. Remember, the stronger the soldiers, the closer you are to winning the battle against market

How to Use Three White Soldiers Candlestick Pattern?

Let us consider this pattern based on the book by famous author Gregory Morris, Candlestick Charting Explained: Timeless Techniques for Trading Stocks and Futures.

Let's see what the author of the book says.

Everything seems to be clear and on the point. Except for one big BUT - in all sources known to me, the three white soldiers is considered a reversal pattern.

Let's say that we have critical thinking and do not believe blindly everything we read. We want to verify everything personally. The author himself comes to the rescue!

Peculiarity number 1.

We see the three white soldiers pattern through the example of the pattern presented by the author. Indeed, after the formation of the pattern, the instrument began to grow confidently and continuously. It is no accident that I singled out the word continuously. This is the first peculiarity - the three white soldiers pattern is a sign of the beginning of a big trend. Specifically in this case, after the formation of the pattern, within three days, the growth continued for more than a month! An interesting observation that each of you can verify - on the basis of only 3 days we can make a forecast for many days or even weeks ahead.

Let us consider a real example. Below is the weekly chart of the NASDAQ-100 index.

We see how, after the patterning of 3 white soldiers, the price continued to grow for several more months.

Peculiarity number 2.

However, let's turn again to the picture provided by the author and try to understand whether or not we saw the trend reversal after the formation of the pattern. And the answer is absolutely NOT! It is easy to see that the reversal happened much earlier. And this is the second peculiarity - the three white soldiers pattern is a CONTINUATION pattern.

It might seem an insignificant remark, but by no means is it so. It is the location of the candle pattern that determines whether it is a pattern or not. Therefore, do not look for the three white soldiers pattern in the very bottom of the chart. The pattern will appear near the bottom, but after a change in trend. This is what we see in Figure 3-71. I should also note that you should not look for this pattern in the area of high prices.

Peculiarity number 3. Structure and Size of the Candles.

Let us turn again to Gregory Morris’s book.

Here the author is absolutely right in all the statements, but you can add a few points.

1) The model will be considered stronger if the upper shadows of the candles are extremely small or completely absent.

This phenomenon will be evidence of the great strength of buyers.

In Japanese sources, the following representation of this model is more common:

There are practically no upper shadows above the candles.

2) In many sources I note the following alleged fact: "Candles should preferably be of medium size, since heavily stretched bodies can mean overbought market."

In my opinion, the statement is extremely doubtful. Almost any trend begins with a strong momentum. In this case, the large size of the candles, relative to the neighboring ones, will indicate the strength of the buyers. In addition, the term overbought can be applied to various financial markets with great reservations: more to the stock market and less to the super liquid foreign exchange market.

Peculiarity number 4. Working out the Pattern.

Let us turn again to the example from the book.

It is easy to see that before going into continued growth after the formation of the pattern, the price previously made a corrective move. My personal experience shows that in most cases it is worth waiting for exactly this behavior of the asset. The price going into growth immediately is extremely rare, although this also happens.

Everyone should decide for themselves how to act in a similar situation. I prefer to wait for the corrective movement and buy the instrument from rollback. If the price does not roll back and immediately goes into growth, I usually just skip such signals. The market is big, there is no need to hurry - there will always be good trading situations.

Another small observation: if after the formation of the pattern in question there is a correctional movement, it very rarely goes beyond the low of the average candle. This observation allows you to lower the stop loss when opening a trading position. Ideally, I try to put the stop loss behind an extreme, or a strong support / resistance level.

Three White Soldiers Examples

Let's take the

USD/JPY

pair as an example. After a period of decline, on day one, the opening price is $111.900, closing at $112.190; day two opens at $112.190, closing at $112.480. On day three, the opening is $112.490, and it closes at a confident $112.770.

This triumphant trio signals a potential trend reversal, reflecting renewed market confidence. When the Three White Soldiers march onto your chart, it's time to consider joining their parade, potentially capitalizing on the upward momentum in the market.

Another example can be seen in the

EUR/USD

pair. Following a downtrend, day one opens at $1.077, closing at $1.078; day two opens at $1.078, closing at $1.079. Day three opens at $1.079, closing at a robust $1.080. This succession of white candles showcases a strong shift in sentiment towards a bullish trend.

In CP stock, a similar pattern emerges. Starting with an opening price of $25.9 on day one, it closes at $26.4. Day two opens at $26.5, closing at $26.8. Day three opens at $26.8, closing confidently at $27.2. This series of ascending candles indicates a potential bullish trend reversal, prompting traders to consider an entry point for long positions in the bull market.

How to Trade Three White Soldiers Pattern: Navigating the Bullish Terrain

Trading based on the Three White Soldiers candlestick is like embarking on a journey through a lush forest, and you're looking for the perfect spot to set up camp. These three bullish candlesticks resemble a trio of soldiers marching in harmony, signaling a potential trend reversal in your favor.

Finding Entry Points

:

Spotting the Soldiers. First, identify the Three White Soldiers pattern, which consists of three consecutive strong bullish candlesticks. These candlesticks should open near the previous close and close higher, forming a stair-step pattern on the chart.

Confirm with Volume. Ensure the pattern is backed by significant

trading volume

, as this indicates the strength of the trend reversal. The more soldiers marching together, the stronger the signal.

Wait for the Third Soldier. The third soldier, with its higher close, is the confirmation you need to enter the trade. A robust third soldier indicates a higher likelihood of a sustained uptrend.

Finding Exit Points

:

Take Your Profits. Just as a successful journey may involve regular breaks, consider taking profits at predefined levels or when the trend shows signs of exhaustion. Aiming for a 2:1 risk-to-reward ratio can be a smart approach.

Use

Trailing Stops

. Think of trailing stops as your compass to navigate through the forest. Move your stop-loss order to lock in profits as the trend progresses. This way, you can capture more gains if the trend continues and protect your capital if it reverses.

Trading with the Three White Soldiers candlestick, like a well-prepared explorer, requires patience, discipline, and risk management. By combining technical analysis with smart entry and exit strategies, you can maximize your chances of a successful trading journey in the financial wilderness.

Three White Soldiers vs Three Black Crows

In the world of trading, patterns often resemble a flock of birds, each with its unique characteristics. Take, for instance, the "Three White Soldiers" and the "Three Black Crows." These two patterns are like day and night in the financial markets.

The "Three White Soldiers" candlestick is a trio of bullish candles that march confidently upward, like an army of confident bulls, signaling a potential uptrend. Each candle opens higher than the previous one, indicating a robust buying sentiment. It's like a cheerful parade with each soldier more eager than the last, shouting "Buy, buy, buy!"

On the flip side, we have the "Three Black Crows," a bearish trio that swoops down on the market, creating a gloomy atmosphere. These crows open lower than the previous candle, symbolizing a bearish sentiment and a potential downtrend. They are like ominous omens cawing, "sell, sell, sell!"

In essence, the difference between these two patterns is like night and day. Three White Soldiers signal a bullish trend, while Three Black Crows indicate a bearish one. So, whether you're following the soldiers or listening to the crows, it's crucial to understand the pattern you're dealing with to make informed trading decisions in the financial wilderness.

Limitations of Using Three White Soldiers Pattern in Trading

Limitation

Description

Relying solely on the Three White Soldiers pattern without considering other factors can be like driving with blinders on. It might overlook critical market conditions or

fundamental analysis

, leading to misinterpretations.

False Signals

Not every appearance of the Three White Soldiers pattern guarantees a strong upward trend. False signals can occur, resulting in losses if traders act solely based on this pattern.

Market Volatility

High market volatility can distort the effectiveness of this pattern. Rapid price swings may invalidate the pattern's bullish signal, causing confusion and potential losses.
