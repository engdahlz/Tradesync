Favorite quote from the author:

Investing is often considered to be a difficult job — but it doesn’t have to be.

A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing

by

Burton G. Malkiel

helps individual investors take charge of their financial journey. Malkiel’s strategy consists of investing in

low-cost index funds

and continuing to do so with every next income stream you create.

If you do so, your wealth accumulates over time without you taking on much risk. It requires patience, however. You’ll have to

keep investing and trust that the market will do its job. You can also try to pick individual stocks, but those will present a higher risk of investment. However, you’ll have to understand a few key tenets first.

Let’s explore them!

Here are my three favorite lessons from the book:

A healthy dose of risk can be good for your portfolio.

You can’t beat the market.

Learn to control the psychological factor of investing.

Let’s dive deeper into these lessons!

Lesson 1: Learn to accept risk as a natural part of an investment strategy and your portfolio evolution.

Risk is everywhere, and the higher the potential return on your investment is, the higher the added risk. In other words, if you invest in a stock that has a promising future and you expect it to grow significantly, you’re essentially exposing yourself to the risk of it performing the opposite. However, if you are indeed right, your stock can have incredible returns for your portfolio.

Learn to accept this part of your

investment strategy

and not fear volatility when it comes your way. Of course, all should be kept within limits. Lower potential downsides are the dream of any investor. So you should aim for blue chips, stable companies with good backgrounds, and a promising future.

Protect yourself from losses by using the Modern Portfolio Theory.

This theory states that you should invest in companies with inversely correlated returns. That way, you will be protecting your money in every given situation. For example, during the pandemic, you could’ve invested both in stay-at-home stocks and travel companies. This is so as to assure a winning finale for your assets. However, not all additional risks present the possibility of higher returns.

One should be able to correctly assess the value of their investments. One can do this by not buying stocks blindly or based on vague recommendations. Doing your own research is one of the most important parts of investing. Moreover, to fully protect your portfolio you should diversify it. Don’t just buy stakes in companies. other options include also purchasing bonds, keeping cash, and going for other financial assets.

Lesson 2: The market favors those who favor the market back.

Some investors are more active, constantly researching new opportunities, others take a more passive approach. Everyone’s measure of comparison? The market. But how do you read the average market performance? For that, you can use index funds.

Index funds are a broad way to invest, as they incorporate a multitude of companies under the same stock price.

Consider the most famous one – S&P 500. This

index fund

incorporates the 500 biggest companies in the USA, and therefore it represents the market. Investing in it is one of the safest ways to build a stock-based portfolio of assets. Why? Because it performs well over time.

However, active investors often want to outperform its returns, as they can prove to be quite low when you check them day by day. Usually, people who love these funds are fine with the idea of investing for their retirement years. Others like to get rich quicker, and so they use fundamental and technical analysis to try to outperform the market. Some even succeed in doing so.

However, for the majority of people, active investing becomes the worst financial mistake of their lives.

Stock-picking may go well at first. However, market correction or simply a stock fall could wipe out months or years of carefully earned returns. Therefore, the author advocates for investing slowly and steadily in low-cost index funds and assuring a good financial future.

Lesson 3: Your mind and emotions dictate your moves in the market.

While it may be easy for you to say that you’ve got full control over your brain and your decisions when it comes to investing, time-proven studies on the market may indicate differently. In fact, investors often do the opposite of what they’d like to accomplish in their trades.

This is due to four faulty traits we have as investors: overconfidence, biased judgments, herd mentality, and loss aversion.

Our biased judgment makes us think that we have some special attributes that allow us to call out future stock prices and therefore count as a viable investment. Usually, we tend to be overconfident and bias at the same time and coerce ourselves to buy stocks that don’t have a fundamental value but feel like a worthy pick for us.

Herd mentality is a strong form of coercion that happens when we feel peer-pressured. This derives from our natural inclination to stick with groups of people, and therefore, change our opinions to coincide with the general group sentiment. In the money market, this can prove to be detrimental to our finances, as we sometimes feel like we should get into hot stocks and not lose the momentum.

However, by the time we get on the gravy train, the stocks are overpriced and we end up assisting their decline. Therefore, never buy a stock just because someone else does so, as you’re most likely going to end up in a bubble that’s about to burst. Lastly, our loss aversion makes it impossible for us to sell a losing position. This is because, as humans,

we can’t stand to lose

. Be rational and always ask yourself if your investment is still viable and worth keeping.
